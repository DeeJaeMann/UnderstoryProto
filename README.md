# UnderstoryProto
This is a prototype for a game called Understory

## Original Game Concept
A Bug's Life, but for adults.

A gritty survival (horror??) RPG set in the understory (bottom layer of a forest). The player plays as one of # small critters: ant, cricket, mayfly, snail (?), earthworm, etc. and must survive a plethora of dangers that the forest poses, from storms to predators to warring factions to species encroachment (humans).
